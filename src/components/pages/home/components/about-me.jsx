            From nearly a decade immersed in marketing and design, I recently
            embraced an exhilarating new challenge: web development. What began
            with courses and small projects has evolved into a passionate
            pursuit of coding excellence. While I'm still early in my
            development journey, I've already progressed from wrestling with
            spaghetti code to crafting clean, thoughtful solutions.
            <br />
            <br /> Each day brings new learning opportunities, and I'm amazed by
            how far I've come â€“ already taking on client projects and building
            real-world applications. My background in design and marketing gives
            me a unique perspective, allowing me to create solutions that are
            both technically sound and visually compelling.
